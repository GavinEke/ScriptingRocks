title: Setting up Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)

LAPS provides a solution to the issue of using a common local administrator account with an identical password on every computer in an active directory domain. LAPS resolves this issue by setting a different, random password for the common local administrator account on every computer in the domain. The local administrator password is stored in Active Directory (AD) as a attribute of the computer and is protected by an Access Control List (ACL) of who can view/modify the attribute.

LAPS can be downloaded as an MSI from [http://aka.ms/laps](http://aka.ms/laps). It is supported on Windows Vista and greater, the solution requires an agent (AdmPwd GPO Extension) installed on client computers to modify the admin password. The MSI also includes an option to install the management tools including a fat client UI, PowerShell module and GPO editor templates.

At the time of writing the current version of LAPS is 6.2

## Installation

Installation is done in 3 parts

1. Install LAPS agent on client computers
2. Upgrade AD schema
3. Copy ADMX templates into the SYSVOL

### Deploy LAPS Agent

LAPS agent can be installed from any number of software deployment solutions including Active Directory Group Policy, Microsoft System Center, PDQ Deploy or manually run on the agent on the client computer.

Silent install LAPS x64 agent from command-line.

```powershell
msiexec.exe /i "LAPS.x64.msi" ALLUSERS=1 /qn /norestart
```

Silent install LAPS x86 agent from command-line.

```powershell
msiexec.exe /i "LAPS.x86.msi" ALLUSERS=1 /qn /norestart
```

### Update AD Schema

To update the AD schema you will need the following items:

* Be a member of the "Schema Admins" security group
* LAPS PowerShell Module (Can be obtained from the MSI)
* PowerShell Console with Remote Server Administration Toolkit (RSAT)

Once you meet the above criteria you can run `Update-AdmPwdADSchema` to perform the schema upgrade. The command should show output with a status of "Success". If all status returns "Success" then you can move on to configuration, if you get an error message or and status returns "Failure" you will need to troubleshoot the problem.

### Copy ADMX Templates into SYSVOL

> In the following examples *'contoso.com'* is the active directory domain.

* Copy **AdmPwd.admx** from **C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions** into **\\\\contoso.com\SYSVOL\contoso.com\Policies\PolicyDefinitions**
* Copy **AdmPwd.adml** from **C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-us** into **\\\\contoso.com\SYSVOL\contoso.com\Policies\PolicyDefinitions\en-us**.

## Configuration

Configuration is done in 2 parts

1. Configure AD Permissions
2. Configure Group Policy

### Configuring AD Permissions

> In the following examples *'Contoso Computers'* is the OU in which client computers are located and *'LAPSAdmins'* is the security group used to grant view/reset ACL permissions of Local Passwords..

The first step in the configuration is to set the permission for which computers can update their own AD account with the new `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` and `ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime` attributes added during the schema update. The OU you specify in the following command will grant the OU specified and any sub-OU SELF permission for the 2 attributes.

```powershell
Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermission –Identity "Contoso Computers"
```

The second step in the configuration is to grant a security group access to view/reset local passwords, This is performed by running the following 2 commands.

```powershell
Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission –Identity "Contoso Computers" –AllowedPrincipals "contoso.com\LAPSAdmins"
Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission –Identity "Contoso Computers" –AllowedPrincipals "contoso.com\LAPSAdmins"
```

### Configuring LAPS GPO

> Do __NOT__ apply the GPO to the *'Domain Controllers'* OU or install the software or your Domain Controllers.

Create a new GPO and go to **Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrator Templates/LAPS**. There are 4 possible policies that can be configured:

* Password Settings
* Name of administrator account to manage
* Do not allow password expiration time longer than required by policy
* Enable local admin password management

The only policy that is mandatory to enable to turn on LAPS is *Enable local admin password management* once this is enabled computers will begin to change their administrator password and store the new password in AD as an attribute of the computer account.

## Management

Viewing/Resetting passwords can be done via GUI or CLI.

### Viewing/Resetting passwords with Fat Client UI

This is self explanatory you can type a name of the computer search which will show the results in the window and allow you to modify the expiration time if you have access.

### Viewing/Resetting passwords with PowerShell

> In the following examples *Computer001* is the computer name used but this can be any computer name in your AD or an array of computer names.

Viewing a password using the LAPS PowerShell module.

```powershell
Get-AdmPwdPassword –Computername "Computer001"
```

Viewing a password using the AD PowerShell module.

```powershell
Get-ADComputer –Identity "Computer001" -prop ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime | Select-Object @{Name="ComputerName";Expression={$_.Name}},DistinguishedName,@{Name="Password";Expression={$_."ms-Mcs-AdmPwd"}},@{Name="ExpirationTimestamp";Expression={(Get-Date 1/1/1601).AddDays(($_."ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime")/864000000000)}}
```

Reset a password using the LAPS PowerShell module.

```powershell
Reset-AdmPwdPassword –Computer "Computer001" –WhenEffective (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)
```

Reset a password using the AD PowerShell module.

```powershell
Set-ADComputer –Identity "Computer001" –Replace @{"ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime"=0} 
```
