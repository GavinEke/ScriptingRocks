PowerShell Core is a major refactor of Windows PowerShell which is now built on top of .NET Core. The reason this was done was to bring PowerShell cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) and the project is now open-source meaning that anyone can view the code, contribute to the project and build a package from the source code.

Now if you are asking ‘Where do I get PowerShell Core 6.0?’ or ‘What’s the difference between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core?’. Please see the blog post by Joey Aiello of the PowerShell Team linked below as he has done a great write up that answers some FAQ.

## Extended FAQ

### Does this mean I must rewrite all my scripts for PSCore?

Short Answer: No  
Long Answer: Although Windows PowerShell is no longer in development it is still supported by Microsoft and it will receive security updates and bug fixes if required. There is no reason you cannot continue to use Windows PowerShell, if you have a script that works with Windows PowerShell just keep using it with Windows PowerShell, unless you have a reason to modify the script to work with PSCore there is nothing you need to do as Windows PowerShell and PSCore can run side-by-side.

### Will there be a PSCore ISE?

Sort of. The Windows PowerShell ISE just like Windows PowerShell is no longer in development but again it is still supported by Microsoft. Microsoft have created a cross-platform product to replace the ISE called VSCode, this is the recommended script editor going forward.

### What’s happening with DSC?

More details will be coming by the end of the month via a blog post by Michael Greene. I will update this when they arrive.

### What’s happening with JEA?

JEA on Windows will work the same, Microsoft will look at the possibility of JEA on non-windows systems in the future.

### Will PSCore become the default console in Windows?

Not yet but it will be considered in the future.

### Will PSCore come to Azure Functions?

It is in the roadmap.
